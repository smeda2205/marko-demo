# ChangeLog

## v1.0.5
* Added `teamDL` API

## v1.0.4
* Added consumer id to the app context
* Added separation of environments for xstage and sandbox, https://github.corp.ebay.com/nodejs/app-context-ebay/issues/4

## v1.0.3
* Fixed: should add suffix in poolName even when process.env.POOL_NAME is specified. This breaks separation of prod and pre-production.

## v1.0.2
* Added suffix to the pool name for pre-production and lnp environments to separate from the rest and avoid double tracking for production in case traffic mirror is used.
* Moved index to lib folder so that sonar can handle it correctly.

## v1.0.1
* Moved from commons-ebay to a standalone module
