* Provides standard ebay instrumentation for generic transports.
* You can define your own transport and have it instrumented via [service-client-ebay module](https://github.corp.ebay.com/nodejs/service-client-ebay).
    Transport interface:

    ```javascript
    function epsTransportFactory() {
      return function epsTransport(options, callback) {
        // do something here
        callback(err, response);
      };
    }
```
* You can define your instrument and register it for others to use: https://github.corp.ebay.com/nodejs/instrument-inc#registration
