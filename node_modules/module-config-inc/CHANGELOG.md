## v0.2.26
* Fixed: should setup path shortstop handler with base path that corresponds to module root for default config and app root for app configs.

* Added shortstop-handler:path. This will allow resolution of properties like this 'location': 'path:./config/config.json'

## v0.2.23
* Changed the way application config bean is defined in config.json. Now it is recommended to define bean name inside application section.
   Example:

   ```json
   "@ConfigBean": {
        "app-name": {
            "bean-name": [
                "services",
                "other-params"
            ]
        }
    }
   ```
